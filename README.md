# File-Allocation-Methods
The allocation methods define how the files are stored in the disk blocks. There are three main disk space or file allocation methods.
1.	Contiguous Allocation 
2.	Linked Allocation 
3.	Indexed Allocation 

The main idea behind these methods is to provide:
1.	Efficient disk space utilization
2.	Fast access to the file blocks

After comparing the different file allocation methods, we came to the conclusion that the best one is indexed file allocation as it supports direct accessing which is faster and efficient, overcomes the disadvantages of both contiguous and indexed file allocation methods. Apart from this, a file allocation table has been made which is the best method to store files. Implementing a file allocation table makes deleting and updating quicker and more efficient
